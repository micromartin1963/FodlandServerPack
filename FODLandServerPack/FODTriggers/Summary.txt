Summary of the 2 main methods called when triggered.

----------------------------------------
FogSteppedIntoArea()
This is for everything else other than sound.
Variables can be passed to this

 
type 2 - teleport , 3 - spawn object , 4 -  message / sound only , 5 - teleport + message , 6 - spawn + message



eg	"TType": 2,  in FOGTRiggersConfig.json  is teleport

	"LocationName" : "Beach location 1",			just for reference
	"TType": 2,						what happens (teleport)
        "FogText": "",						string to show if TType is  4 or 6
	"OrigVectorStr":	"9619 7 1816",			where  the trigger point is
	"TargetVectorStr": "9634 6 1813",			where to spawn item in classname or where to teleport to 
	"TargetRot" : "",					not used yet
        "FogRadius" : "10.2",					how far away from trigger point we can trigger
        "FogClassnameStr" : "",					classname of object to spawn eg ZmbM_FOGPseudoGiant
	"FogSoundIndex" : 100001,				explained below
	"StandDownTime" : 60,					how long till next trigger possible (cooldown)
	"ShowMarker" : 1					shows marker at trigger point for testing purposes

eg	"TType": 3, spawn object

	"LocationName" : "Beach location 2",
	"TType": 3,						spawn object
        "FogText": "",
	"OrigVectorStr":	"9661 7 1806",
	"TargetVectorStr": "9679 5 1809",			to here
	"TargetRot" : " 0.0 0.0 0.0",
        "FogRadius" : "10.2",
        "FogClassnameStr" : "ZmbM_FOGPseudoGiant",		what to spawn
	"FogSoundIndex" : 100001,				didn't really need to do sound but did one anyway as an alarm
	"StandDownTime" : 10,
	"ShowMarker" : 1

eg	"TType": 4, message (but if you leave "FogText" param "" you can do sound only)

	"LocationName" : "Church Location 1",
	"TType": 4,
        "FogText": "Church Location 1",				Didn't really need message leave blank if sound only wanted
	"OrigVectorStr":	"6477.18 8.66 2366.69",
	"TargetVectorStr": "",
	"TargetRot" : "",
        "FogRadius" : "10.2",
        "FogClassnameStr" : "",
	"FogSoundIndex" : 300002,
	"StandDownTime" : 30,
	"ShowMarker" : 1
        },

FogSteppedIntoAreaFromSync()
This seems to be the only way to get sound to play !
This is triggered when m_fogtrigger changes
Trouble is that you cannot seem to pass variables to anything so
the way the sound is played or looped is in the soundset name and split up to
get it to do what you want .
But in retrospect this is probably more efficient than any other method. (less variables being passed)

	//!!!!!!! soundset format  FOG_SoundSet_XYYNNN
	// X = type (see below) , Y = seconds of loop , NNN sounset num
	// 1 = play at trigger point (No loop)

	// 3 = play on person (No loop)
	// 4 = play at trigger pos (loop for YY seconds)

	// 6 = play on person (loop for YY seconds)

	// 320003  eg FOG_SoundSet_620003 plays on person for 20 seconds 
	// 100001     FOG_SoundSet_100001 plays at trigger point once
	// 160001     FOG_SoundSet_120001 will not play at trigger point once because its type one ,so YY is ignored ! it should be 420001

	so when creating soundsets take into account if you want a looping sound or not or create both !
